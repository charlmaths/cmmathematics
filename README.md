A sandbox for my personal site. It needs further development, rather, I'll keep developing it.

This is currently hosted on GitHub Pages (subject to change).

The aim is for a terminal-style website. I like the aesthetics of CLIs and Linux environments, and I want to experiment with implementing commands so the site behaves more like an actual terminal.

I’m using Claude Code/ChatGPT alongside this project and will try to keep track of any AI-assisted changes. This is also a way for me to learn so I'll keep track of that as well and test myself.
